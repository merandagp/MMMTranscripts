**The House**

*Birds singing with drilling noise in the background, continuous*

Me: I think the clearest difference between my Mechanicsville and what stands in its shoes today, is the houses. 

Me: It’s just a shame that like we know what it means. 
Dad: What’s that? You mean uh?
Me: Like this for sale sign like there’s no hope.
Dad: No, no, no, no. No, no. 

Me: This is not an unusual conversation between my dad and I on one of our walks. For sale signs have become a signal in the area that sends a clear message: this house is coming down. 

*Footsteps walking up a gravel path*

Me: Our house had a gravel path leading up to it’s creaky front door. 

*Creaky door opens, slow piano music starts and continues*

Me: I lived in that same house in Mechanicsville, 189 Hinchey Ave., from 1997 to 2020. That was my entire life until we moved. My Dad lived there from...

Dad: ...from the early, no late 80s, say '89 till 2020.

Me: and my mom moved into Mechanicsville...

Mom: ...in 1982, I left in 2020. So that was 38 years.

Me: And the house saw many years before us, having probably been built in 1874. There is a lot of life wrapped up in those four walls… or should I say there was. 

Mom: The home um was a two story um long and skinny because the lots were all 25 by hundred.

Dad: It had character, it was a nice, pleasant little house. But um I think it had, I would say, past its due date, though, it was beyond uh with the work it needed on it.

Mom: None of those houses were really built to last a hundred years, they were built with scrap from the lumber mills. So, I don't think you would have been able to keep it looking beautiful. And, yeah, no the memories weren't with the house.

*Creaky door opens and closes, piano music starts to fade away footstep walking down gravel path*

Me: I guess it was never really the house itself that mattered. It was the memories we made there. 

Dad: No, I think we had a lot of funny times there. It was a good house. Many Christmases. We did well there. Yeah. Mm mm.

*Birds singing with drilling noise in the background, continuous and fades out*

Me: That’s why Mechanicsville means so much to me. A neighbourhood, a space… It isn’t a place until we make it one. A House isn’t a home until it means something to us. Which means a place can last even when the space itself has changed… My Mechanicsville can exist even though this neighbourhood doesn’t look anything like it.
