**The Street**

*Ambient traffic in the distance, continuous*

Me: Now the street hums loudly, with its cars and machines. But they used to sing a different song.

*Fade in road hockey sounds, hockey sticks clashing, footsteps running, continuous*

Dad: I know ball hockey was huge with my son,

Me: By that he means my brother,

Dad: and the the girls in the neighbourhood too, played.

Me: And by that he means me. 

Dad: It was it was ball hockey, but it was kind of a big thing. Locations varied sometimes as numbers grew of the players. So, yeah, I recall that is a big thing at that point in that neighbourhood, I um yeah, there was siblings and sisters and older brothers of various people playing. 

Me: I remember on Carruthers especially, I think that was the main street that we played on.

Dad: Yes. Oh boy. Yeah, yeah. Oh, hours and dark it would be. But we didn't have a lot of traffic through. All neighbours, whether they had children involved, were usually sitting out in the evenings on the porch. So there was a good what's going on, you knowâ€¦

*Road hockey continues, players yell car as one rushes past, then yell in play and the sounds continue and fade to silence*
