**The Sidewalk**

*Footsteps continuous*

Me: I sometimes think about who will be travelling the sidewalks of Mechanicsville in 5 years. 

Me: A young professional couple with their furbaby prancing proudly in front of them. *Dog barking*

Me: A bright-eyed toddler stumbling along under the watchful gaze of their grandfather.

Me: A lone figure who just can’t wait to crawl into a warm bed. *Man sighing heavily*

Me: These people aren’t that different from those I see in the area today, or those who I remember seeing yesterday. It’s just that, I don’t know these people and they don’t know me. How could they? 

*Background noise changes, more machine sounds and construction*

Me: I think over here, I think it was this one

Dad: That you marked the name? 

Me: No it was this one

Dad: Is it still there? Not much showing.

Me: Like vaguely…

Dad: Yeah

Me: You can kind of see

*Footsteps continuous*

Me: When I was at the age when learning to write your own name rocked my world, the only thing more exciting was a blank canvas of permanent proportions, freshly laid concrete. I remember gleefully writing my full name in that pristine slab of sidewalk right outside our front door. Much to the horror of my parents who were understandably concerned about the security hazards that come along with having your kid’s full name as a public welcome mat.

*Background noise changes, more machine sounds and construction*

Me: Who would have… Did you think… When we were... Cause I remember I wrote my name

Dad: yes yeah

Me: Did you ever think that at the time that this would be the only thing left?

Dad: No, that's a long time back. No, no and it was just part of growing up. Y’know?

Me: Yeah.

*Footsteps continuous*

Me: So here is the beautiful, poetic line I had scripted to say here: 

Me: “Now it almost feels like a reprisal. Like in some small way I’ve left a mark on Mechanicsville like it left its mark on me.”

Me: Which is very sweet in sentiment, only that mark, doesn’t exist anymore. I went down to Hinchey Ave. to take a photo of my signature, sitting proudly in almost permanent concrete, to find it gone. Like almost everything else I’ve talked about here, that one slab of sidewalk was crudely covered in uneven asphalt by the developers who wouldn’t even have known it was there....

Me: Further up the street, I saw the funniest thing. Part of the sidewalk had recently been laid, and in it, I saw the scribblings of a child imprinted in it. Some things change but still they stay the same. Places change yet still they stay the same, it’s just part of the process… and I think I’m starting to be okay with that. I wonder if, in 20 years time, that signature will still be there, or if it will just fade into another memory…
